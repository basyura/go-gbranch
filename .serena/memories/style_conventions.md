# Style & conventions
- Go standard conventions: tabs for indentation; CamelCase types; lowerCamel variables/functions.
- Keep functions small and focused; prefer clear names over comments.
- Avoid new dependencies unless needed for CLI output or Git parsing.
- Keep output deterministic for CLI parsing.
- Do not edit built artifact gbranch.exe.
